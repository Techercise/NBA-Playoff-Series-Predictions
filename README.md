#NBA-Playoff-Predictions

This project tries to predict if an NBA team will make the playoffs, using a Deep Neural Network, based off of their regular season offensive and defensive team statistics starting from the 1979 - 1980 season (when the three-point shot was introduced). Wins and losses are not a part of the data set as the goal is to find out if team statistics are a good playoff predictor. All statistics come from basketball-reference.com.
